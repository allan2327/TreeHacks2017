# TreeHacks2017

We wrote a Facebook Messenger chatbot to allow users to report an occurrence of online harassment.  This specific bot is designed
for Twitter, but one could imagine generalizing/repurposing it for use on other websites.  The chatbot itself was created and trained
with the gorgeous wit.ai platform, and we use a Flask web app hosted on Heroku to integrate with Facebook's Messenger.
